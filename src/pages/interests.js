    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>After a number of years playing football I have recently returned to rugby, trying league for a change and turn out for my local side the <a href="https://skanestags.com">Skane Stags</a> (you might be able to guess who made their new responsive PWA!?!).</p>

    <p>Less physically involved activities I enjoy include reading, continually attempting to learn to play the guitar and occassionally brewing beer.</p>
