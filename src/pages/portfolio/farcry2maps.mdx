<h3>Experience</h3>

My first published Android app, produced during my Malmö Yrkeshögskolan course on app development. The app is intended to be an aid when playing the game Far Cry 2 as it contains all the maps for the game, including the location of various useful items which are needed during play. One of the biggest difficulties encountered here was retaining the information passed through the app when going back (phone's back button) or up (from the toolbar) from the third screen to the second.

<ul>
    <li>Grid Layout</li>
    <li>Consistent navigation when using Back v Up</li>
    <li>Using a colour picker and an invisible overlay to make a portion of a screen clickable</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics & Ads</li>
    <li>Deploying an app to the Google Play Store</li>
    <li>Responding to Google Play reviews, both good and not so helpful!</li>
</ul>
