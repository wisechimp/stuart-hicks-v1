<h3>Experience</h3>

The final project from the Udemy course [The Complete React Native and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) course. The course is slightly out of date at the present time so there were a few times when troubleshooting was required to upgrade deprecated/out of favour code/tools or UX improvements that had been overlooked on the course. Learning points included:
<ul>
    <li>Authentication, reading and writing to Firebase</li>
    <li>Styling and layouts with flexbox</li>
    <li>ListView with custom cells</li>
    <li>Navigation and passing data between screens</li>
    <li>Sending a SMS</li>
    <li>Modals to act as a failsafe</li>
</ul>
